The SP4000 range of high performance, network-centric HDD and SSD managed
storage solutions provides unprecedented scalability and performance for high
end data storage and buffering tasks.

The SP4000C is a compact 4U 19” rack-mountable 48-bay managed storage solution,
with 2.5” hot-swap drive support. It is intended for high bandwidth networked
storage or buffering applications. It supports a wide range of 2.5” SATA HDDs
and SSDs. The primary data interface is 40 Gb Ethernet, with a total SSD
storage capacity of up to 96 TB per unit. Up to 16 secondary SAS interfaces
allow the unit to directly manage archival storage (e.g. tape drive arrays) or
additional SAS JBODs.

The SP4000L is a 4U, 19” rack-mountable top-loading 48-bay managed storage
solution. It is intended for high capacity storage clusters, where it achieves
a remarkable storage-capacity-to-cost-ratio using high capacity 3.5” SATA HDDs.
Data interfacing is achieved through 10 Gb Ethernet interfaces, with a total
storage capacity of up to 384 TB per unit (using 8TB HDDs).

The SP4000 series is the ideal hardware platform on which to implement high
performance/high redundancy RAID arrays, as well as scalable network-centric
object stores (e.g. Ceph Object Store Daemons), for data-centric compute.
